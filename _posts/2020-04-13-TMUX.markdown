[TMUX](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) is a terminal multiplexer, you can have multiple workspaces, interchange between them and even split the window. Very handy when you need to run various programs at the same time.

When you close Tmux it keep the session alive, so you can ssh a machine, start a tmux session, close the terminal and connect again to the tmux on that machine and everything will be exactly as when you leave.

Another powerful feature is it can share the session, you can connect multiple times from distinct machines and you will see the same content, something like a shared remote desktop.

From the command line:

- `tmux`: start a new session
- `tmux -ls`: list opened session
- `tmux a -t 0`: attach to session named 0
- `tmux kill-server`: kill the server and all sessions opened

When inside tmux, you can send instructions to tmux with `Ctrl-b`, everything has that as a prefix.

- `Ctrl-b q`: detach from tmux, you return to regular command line but tmux keep all the session active in the background

Working with windows:

- `Ctrl-b c`: create a new window
- `Ctrl-b n`: select next window
- `Ctrl-b p`: select previous window
- `Ctrl-b c`: create a new window
- `Ctrl-b &`: kill window, but you can use the `exit` command

Working with panes (window's divisions):

- `Ctrl-b "`: split horizontally the window
- `Ctrl-b %`: split vertically the window
- `Ctrl-b o`: change to the next pane
- `Ctrl-b <arrow key>`: Change to the pane on the arrow key direction 
- `Ctrl-b x`: kill the pane, but is easy to use `exit` only
- `Ctrl-b z`: zoom/unzoom  the current pane, makes the current pane occupy all the space

Tmux has three levels of organization: sessions, windows, panes.

A session can have multiples windows and a window can be divided into multiples vertical and horizontal panes.

You can send instructions by command name with `Ctrl-b :`, on the bottom you can see the tmux command line and can write commands, for example:

- `new-session`: create a new session
- `kill-session`: delete the session

Session hot keys:

- `Ctrl-b (`: select previous session
- `Ctrl-b )`: select next session
- `Ctrl-b $`: rename the session

You can find the full hotkeys list with `Ctrl-b ?` and get more information on the [TMUX Wiki](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
